Update homepage -- text and components. Home Android, better motion - phone suited?  
Find better icons & apply uniformly, not emojis 3d-ish maybe?

Nav bar should be polymorphic throughout
Nav bar in android components aren't well setup


Dark/light mode issues (text not seen & modes not rendered correctly)


MIssing icons in Desktop? They show as boxes

/math -- We need a better visualization for this Including the homepage (Subjects etc). Also, UI is off (columns) & the three sections: Problems slved, Dily streak etc Needed? 
     --- Select default font throughout & color scheme. Changes depending on dark/light mode.
   -- See the wierd large number in progress, we need to fix that.


Remove duck visualization & move to robots & 3D SVgs (signs, or stuff like that) as per new Hero updates&

If answer is correct, just move to next, remove 'Next One!' button

For Sections needing inputs: for desktop, use keyboard (no screen keyboard) & for android: use Web clean fun keyboard but apply measures to prevent phone's Keyboard from activating
