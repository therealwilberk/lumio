**Learning:** In educational applications, users (especially children) benefit greatly from real-time validation checklists that explain *why* a submission button is disabled. This reduces frustration and provides clear goals. Pairing these with ARIA labels for icon-only toggles ensures the form is both intuitive and accessible.
**Action:** Always implement a requirements checklist when using complex validation, and ensure all interactive icons have descriptive ARIA labels.
